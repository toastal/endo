# You Don't Need This Package

###### But you can use it if you want

This mostly exists to show a pattern since this package is only one thing.

```elm
type alias Endo a =
    a -> a
```

So why is this useful? Well for one it can make type signatures more concise, but more importantly, it lets you know that the type didnâ€™t change. Letâ€™s look at an example of  common code:

```elm
type alias P =
    { x : Int, y : Int }

type alias Point =
    Point P

coordinates : List Point
coordinates =
    [ Point { x = 0, y = 0 }
    , Point { x = 1, y = 2 }
    , Point { x = 8, y = 4 }
    ]
```

So one task might be that we want to reset all of the x coordinates to 0. Normally weâ€™d do this with `List.map`.

```elm
setX : a -> { r | x : a } -> { r | x : a }
setX x_ r =
    { r | x = x_ }

mapPoint : (P -> P) -> Point -> Point
mapPoint fn (Point p) =
    Point (fn p)

newCoordinates : List Point
newCoordinates =
    List.map (mapPoint (setX 0)) coordinates
```

Thatâ€™s fine and it works, but itâ€™s a little verbose and when mapping a `Point` we really want to ensure that cannot modify the types along the line. Because Elm frowns upon the use of optics, a map function is usually used as a _setter_ of sorts and a setter shouldnâ€™t change the types.

So if we go back to `Endo`, you can see that we can say these types do _not_ change.

```elm
type alias Endo a =
    a -> a

setX : a -> Endo { r | x : a }
setX x_ r =
    { r | x = x_ }

mapPoint : Endo P -> Endo Point
mapPoint fn (Point p) =
    Point (fn p)

newCoordinates : List Point
newCoordinates =
    List.map (mapPoint (setX 0)) coordinates
```

So, you can pull this package in â€¦ or not, and just make you own `Endo` in your project ðŸ¤·.
